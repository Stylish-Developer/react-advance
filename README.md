# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

About React
ReactJS is an open source JS library for building user interface.
It's JS library not framework.
It's focusing on doing only one thing and doing that one thing well.
It's doesn't focusing any other aspects like routing,HTTP request and other all.It's focusing on building the rich userInterface.

react is component based and declarative - react lets you breakdown your application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make complex ui. - we have tell to react what we want and react with its react dom library will build the actual ui.
means,
we have tell to react what the ui should looks like react will create the actual UI for us.

that's all.

About Component
Component is basically the code inside the .js, .jsx file.
components describe a part of the UI. they are reuseable and can be nested inside other components. - its has two types - functional components. - stateless component - class components. - statefull component

---

# Event handling Concept is skipped - its simple onClick event with camelCase explained with two types of components

# Styling and css basics concepts has 4 types. 1 css stylesheets 2 inline styling 3 css modules 4 css in js libraries ( styled components )

---

# React Fragment

- React fragment is nothing. it's just an one root umbrella div for a component

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
final concept of this project is HTTP method.

for that i highly recommend checkout my Rest API repository to you. on that repository i continued this https with axios fulfilled.
